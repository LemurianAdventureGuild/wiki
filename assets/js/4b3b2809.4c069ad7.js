I ended up pinned underneath one of the wagons, but it meant the dragon never noticed me. I was the only one to survive. After the dragon left, I pulled together whatever I could from the wreckage and waited for another caravan to come through. I bartered my way onto it and ended up in the Hershey Empire with nothing but the torn dress on my back. Things were... bad there. I ended up stealing to survive and found out I was pretty good at it. So when I saw a guy in fancy clothes strutting around, I though I'd try my luck. Turned out it was Alvis. He caught me in a second, of course. I was so scared, I thought for sure I was about to lose a hand. But instead, he asked if I wanted a job. He gave me some simple little tasks to do, but he made them sound so important, and in exchange he gave me all the food I could eat and a new dress. When he was leaving I begged him to take me along, and so I wound up here. I picked up things here and there just watching people train when I had time. When we got a little older, my sisters and I started begging for them to let us take missions. It wasn't until we were 14 they finally let us take some of the low risk ones.
