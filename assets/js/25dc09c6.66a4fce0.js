The Kingdom Army garrisoned at Hebring moved quickly and intercepted the warband before they could reach the city. Several battles occurred in the forests and hills before the Kingdom Army managed to push the goblin forces out into the open plains where mounted calvary units were able to break through the enemy lines and break the back of the warband.
