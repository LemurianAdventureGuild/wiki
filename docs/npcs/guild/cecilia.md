# Cecilia

The Silver Valkyrie

Current Commander of the Lemurian Guild

Years ago, she made a name for herself as one of the most fearsome fighters in the Guild's history.
Age is now catching up to her, and she has hung up her lance in exchange for a quill.
As Commander, she oversees all Guild activity, though she spends a majority of her time in meetings with the King, the Royal Council, and various nobles.
