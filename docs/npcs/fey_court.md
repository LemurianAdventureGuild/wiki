## The Fey Court

### Sylvia
Leader of a delegation of Fey who delivered news of Marfros's defeat and came to collect on the King's breached contract. Has a mysterious past with Wendy.

> Wendy wakes up from her exhaustion induced sleep and runs back to the portal room as soon as the nurses clear her. She approaches, places her hands on the stone, and closes her eyes for a few moments. The portal's golden surface ripples and turns bright blue. A group of fey step out, a female sylph leading them.
> 
> Wendy exclaims something in Sylvan to the leader and is cut off by the resounding *crack* of the other woman slapping her across the face. Wendy takes a step back from shock and falls silent as the woman speaks. After a quick exchange, Wendy nods and leads them to Cecilia's office. Wendy and the sylph enter while the other four stay outside the door.

### Sylvia's Retinue
> The fey here are of four different races. ... They speak to you in Sylvan

#### Cillian
> One is a small gnome looking creature dressed in green.

Cillian speaks in an Irish/Scottish accent and enjoys playing immature tricks.

> "No, a mean trick is lacing your boots together. Right Cillian." She looks down pointedly where the small man in green was taking advantage of your distraction and reaching for your shoes. "Oy! Ye ruined me fun!" he yells indignantly.

#### Odette
> There is a rather human looking woman with gentle eyes.

Odette's mother was from the mortal plane. She has an ability to see internal motivations by looking in your eyes.

> "You can't," she says breezily, "except to help us pass the time. Now let me look at you both." She stares into your eyes one at a time giving thoughtful hums.

> She shakes her head and looks back to Raffolo. "What I did is gift you with a glimpse into the trajectory of your soul, and I questioned if it was really taking you to where you want to be."

#### Roselia
> Another is of human size and shape, but her skin and hair are varying shades of green and she is clad in green silks decorated with flowers.

Roselia is relatively kind and amused by mortals on this plane. Raffolo is smitten with her.

> She regards you closely. "Hmm yes, I sense the touch of the wilds upon you. You may call me Roselia. May I have your name?"

> Roselia smiles at you warmly as you return.

#### Merrug
> The last is a small creature with cloven goat hooves for feet and a wild mane of hair that looks like braids of iron strands. 

Merrug lost half of his tribe in the fighting and is angry with Lemuria for its failure to contain Marfros.

> The small hoofed man growls, "Your king failed to uphold a bargain. We're here to collect."

> "In vain?" the small fey with hooves seethes.
>
> "Merrug, wait," Roselia says, but he shoves past her and stomps up to Ravinust.
> 
> "You want to know if your friend's death was in vain? Well let me tell you. It was. You failed. You were supposed to keep him here, in exile. You were supposed to stop him from getting back. And. You. Failed. You failed, your friend failed, all your comrades failed. Marfos escaped this hellhole of a plane, and he kicked off a war that killed half my tribe, and you know what? That sounds an awful lot like dying in vain, wouldn't you say?"
