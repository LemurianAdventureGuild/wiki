## Memorial

### Cecilia

> "Ninja" as she was known to most of us exemplified the bravery of this Guild. When she learned that some of our companions were captured and we had an opportunity to get them back, she leaped at the chance to save them despite the danger. We honor her memory today and the sacrifices she made to us and to this nation. Ninja, we will continue on following your example of valor.

### Thisalbrook

> Thisalbrook quietly stands and makes a few heartfelt statements about Ninja's bravery and sacrifice. "May we all be so lucky to have one as Ninja called as friend and companion."

### Isair

> *Isair thanks everyone for their kind words then regails everyone with a heartrending eulogy recounting some of his favorite memories with her going back even before they joined the Guild. Then he steps down and rejoins his sister in the crowd.*

### Kelkori

> *Kelkori stands* "I did not know Ninja long, but I was witness to her final moments. She danced through that battle with the quickness of the great owl spirit," *he clutches the owl skull hanging around his neck* "A skill in battle I am striving for everyday. She dove through the battle seeming to care more for our lost guild members than her own safety, but we were too late. The Syndicate guards cut her down while I was blocked from getting to her by that alchemist. The last thing she said to me was 'get that alchemist at all costs!' And in one last act of treachery the Syndicate shackled her as she lay dying. Even the combined might of Bullroarer and myself could not pull her through the portal to safety. I swear VENGEANCE on the Syndicate this day!" *He lifts his Morningstar into the the air*
