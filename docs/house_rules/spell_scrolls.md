# Spell Scrolls

## Casting

You must have the spellcasting class feature to use a spell scroll.
If the spell scroll is of a spell level higher than what you are currently capable of casting, you must make an arcana check to cast the spell (DC = `11 + spell level`).
If you fail the check, the spell fizzles and the spell scroll is still destroyed. Spell scrolls use the casting time of the original spell.

If you wish to use a spell scroll with a cast time of `bonus action` or `reaction`, then this spell must be equipped to your [quick access slot](./Extra_Bonus_Action_Options#quick-access-potion).

## Crafting

Characters may create magic scrolls during downtime by performing the following actions:

- Pay gp for the magical material supplies; cost depending on the level of the spell, see table below.
- Spend time units equal to the level of the spell (ie spend 1 time unit for a first level spell, 2 time units for 2nd level, etc). This can be split across multiple rests.
- Cast the spell from their prepared spell list and expend the spell slot.
- Provide any material components required to cast the spell (if any).

Spell Level | Price
---|---
1st | 25 gp
2nd | 75 gp
3rd | 225 gp
4th | 675 gp
