# Standing from Prone

Standing up from [Prone](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Prone) costs 15 feet of movement (opposed to an amount of movement equal to half your speed) and provokes attacks of opportunity.
Some actions may be performed from the ground, but penalties may be applied at DM's discretion.
