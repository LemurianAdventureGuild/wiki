Spawned from average parents (_4 +0 , 2 +1, 1 -1 stat roll_) into a standard familial unit, Tar'kiz's (_Standard Array_) parental units spent their spare income on books to educate their son.
Tar'kiz graducated from 5 prestigious universities in artificing with straight **E**'s for **E**xcellence. _(He was **E**xpelled from 5 universities for producing hazards)._
Hearing of the Lemurian Adventure Guild's Fey Portal, he infiltrated the Guild _(went on a mission after only sitting around in the Library)_ where he studies the portal to learn how to weaponize it.

His archnemesis is Trithagerous due to his annoying nature.

Tar'kiz powers his artificer cannon within a Möbius Cube battery powered by a demon he sealed away summoned by Ravinust by accident in the library.

## Languages

Common, Infernal, Primordial, Telepathy (don't need to share a language, but the contacted creature must understand at least one), Thri-kreen

_"Thri-kreen telepathy has no limitations of language barriers with intelligent creatures."_

_"Devil engineering makes good weapo... I mean thermodynamics, so I learned their language._

_Gnomish since they're known for being tinkerers._

## Retiring from Adventuring

Tar'kiz has retired from adventuring and is now one of the primary portal tuners.
