Devised by Thri-keen artificier Tar'kiz after the Fiend Town incident to aid with the Marfros mayhem and future other intraplanar events.

Tarkiz's original pitch:

> "My creative, brilliant Thri-keen mind solved the hardest parts.
> There is now a project name Planar Detector for Instability, Distortion, or Debilitation Yowler and also I created the alert sound for [when the detector goes off](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIeUtaqKrg0).
> Now to just build the detector part. I am now taking on PhD researchers and research assistants.
> You will be paid in experience and your names on the publication will be in order, after myself of course, of how helpful you were."
> I don't know why people keep asking if Alvis had input on the name."
