<p>The Invictus Syndicate is a mysterious group operating in the shadows of Lemuria. The Syndicate&#x27;s aims are destructive, and they have no qualms about hurting innocents to get what they want. It is therefore a main duty of the Lemurian Guild to fight back against the Syndicate&#x27;s goals. They appear to use a portal magic similar to the Guild&#x27;s portal to move agents around the world. The details of their portal and differences to the guild&#x27;s portal are currently unknown.</p>
<p>The Syndicate uses a branch and cell structure which makes rooting out the entire organization difficult, if not impossible. Often agents in a cell will have very few details about what they are doing, why they are doing it, or even the identity of their immediate superior. Branches seem to work independently of one another and have at times even seemed at odds with one another. Still Syndicate agents, especially those in leadership positions, are extremely powerful and are not to be taken lightly.</p>

<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="super-soldier-serum">Super Soldier Serum<a href="#super-soldier-serum" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Super Soldier Serum" title="Direct link to Super Soldier Serum">​</a></h3>
<p>The Syndicate, to the Guild&#x27;s knowledge, began their research into making super soldier serums when Gaille and other guildmates encounter a group of <a href="#enhanced-serial-killer">enchanted serial killers on a mission</a>. Rikku diagnosed that the bodies were altered so that the recipient&#x27;s mind and body were into an &#x27;alchemical abomination&#x27; (to quote Cass, medical examiner). At a later point in time, guildmembers were kidnapped by the Syndicate and forced to drink potions that left them with a range of effects -- some transient like bark skin (Red Paw), and others like a permanent ability to speak to plants (Gaille).</p>
<p>After the <a href="#attack-on-dow-chemical">Dow Chemical Factory incident</a>, Cass reports that the bodies of the super soldier proto-types were bigger and stronger than that of the norm for that species. Notable remarks include injection punctures in the arms, irregular growth spurts in the skeletal structures, brain deterioration, and alchemical irregularities with blood.</p>
<p>The next encounter occurred at <a href="#capture-of-numrikar-and-rezzir">Rae Lake</a>. The aftermath concluded with a known confirmed Syndicate alchemist (Dr. Mauro) -- who escaped using a Syndicate portal -- and two super soldier corpses. With a clever use of Speak with Dead, we learned that the Syndicate was actively refining their alchemical serum through human experimentation. Retrospectively, the attack on the Dow Chemical Factory and Mephiti attack were <strong>distractions to procure more alchemic materials.</strong></p>
<p>At Ylisse Citadel, guild members were dispatched to take care of super soldiers running rampant. The formula for the serum has been refined: they have an innate Blur spell cast on them, higher durability (stony skin and difficult to hit), super speed, magical weapons, and a damaging force with a 25ft range. He was also resistant to physical and magical attacks. After defeating the soldier, the guildmembers found the missing Rikku speaking with another male voice. The mysterious male character conjured a Syndicate portal and both of them disappeared. Rikku, one of the Tavern Trio, is confirmed at this point to work for the Syndicate.</p>
<p>A Syndicate alchemist, Alex, is captured on an unrelated mission. Through him, we discover that the Syndicate has placed devil contracts that bar them from exposing any secrets. When trying to parse the thoughts of devil contract holders, the caster of Detect Thoughts a Devil will expel them out of their mind.</p>
<p>Known Syndicate Alchemists Working on the Super Soldier Serum:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dr. Mauro (status: deceased/unknown)</li>
<li>Agmus Alderon (Status: Alive, imprisoned in Numergard)</li>
<li>Rikku (Status: Rescued)</li>

<p>Paine&#x27;s wherabouts are currently unknown. It is suspected the Syndicate has placed her under a similar gaess as Rikku and Yuna.</p>

<p>Rikku was captured by the Syndicate along with Yuna and Paine. She was put under a devil&#x27;s contract brainwashed with a gaess to assist in making the super hero syndrome.</p>
<p>She was successfully rescued by guildmembers and is now recovering safety in the guild. She is still under a devil&#x27;s contract and is unable to talk much about her experiences.</p>
<p>See <a href="/wiki/npcs/guild/tavern_trio">Rikku&#x27;s page</a> for more information.</p>

<p>The Guild was sent to stop a a wave of serial killings. During the mission they were able to recover the body of one of the serial killers. Rikku examined the corpse and determined that the body was physically enhanced through alchemy. A side effect of the treatment was deterioration of sections of the brain.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="guild-attack">Guild Attack<a href="#guild-attack" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Guild Attack" title="Direct link to Guild Attack">​</a></h3>
<p>The Syndicate was able to launch a surprise attack on Guild headquarters by taking control of the portal and sending multiple teams in to attack. The Guild was able to repell attackers in the Library and the Archives. After the attack was repelled it was determined that the Tavern Trio (Yuna, Rikku, and Paine) were kidnapped in the attack.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="sleeper-agent-in-the-guild">Sleeper Agent in the Guild<a href="#sleeper-agent-in-the-guild" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Sleeper Agent in the Guild" title="Direct link to Sleeper Agent in the Guild">​</a></h3>
<p>The resident portal expert, Zeradnyk (former Syndicate employee), was caught trying to break into the Vault below the Guild and steal the Heart of Strife. The guild team prevented the theft, but Zeradnyk was killed in the figth due to a Ring of Loyalty. Zeradnyk has since been assumed as the reason the Syndicate was able to use the Guild portal in their attack.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-black-dragon-ceremony">The Black Dragon Ceremony<a href="#the-black-dragon-ceremony" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Black Dragon Ceremony" title="Direct link to The Black Dragon Ceremony">​</a></h3>
<p>A huge pulse of magic alerted the Guild to Syndicate activity. The Guild was able to pinpoint the source of the pulse to the Swamps of Duloc. All available members were sent to the Swamps to stop the Syndicate. They found a ritual being performed to transform Yuna into the Black Dragon. Only Feirfiz was able to reach Yuna. He was not able to rescue her and had to kill her before the ritual was completed. As Feirfiz struck her down Yuna was able to say, &quot;Thank you.&quot;</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="capture-of-numrikar-and-rezzir">Capture of Numrikar and Rezzir<a href="#capture-of-numrikar-and-rezzir" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Capture of Numrikar and Rezzir" title="Direct link to Capture of Numrikar and Rezzir">​</a></h3>
<p>A Dr. Mauro was demonstrating a soldier enhancing potion for the army. The test subject, Jed, took the potion and went on a rampage. The guild sent a team to stop Jed. They were successful, but Dr. Mauro escaped. In addition, Numrikar and Rezzir investigated a portal that was left open. The portal closed behind them and they are assumed captured by the Syndicate.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="attack-on-dow-chemical">Attack on Dow Chemical<a href="#attack-on-dow-chemical" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Attack on Dow Chemical" title="Direct link to Attack on Dow Chemical">​</a></h3>
<p>The guild responded to an attack on the City of Dow. They dispatched a couple waves of attacking mephitis and rescued many citizens in the attack. Toward the end of the mission they stumbled upon a crew of people taking alchemy ingredients out of the Dow Chemical factory through a magic portal. The Guild sent a team to investigate. The team was able to link the the portal to past missions with the Syndicate. They came to the conclusion that James Son of Hen was a Syndicate agent that infiltrated the factory, then started the Mephiti attack and opened the portal. The Mephiti attack was most likely a cover for the alchemical component theft.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="guild-outpost-attack">Guild Outpost Attack<a href="#guild-outpost-attack" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Guild Outpost Attack" title="Direct link to Guild Outpost Attack">​</a></h3>
<p>A guild outpost sent a message that it was being attacked. A team was sent and encountered two Alchemically Enhanced soldiers slaughtering the Guild members at the outpost. During the encounter the team discovered that an invisible magic caster, Doc, was supervising the attack and taking notes. The two enhanced soldiers were defeated and Doc escaped through a Syndicate portal. The corpses of the soldiers were brought back to Guild Headquarters and Gaille was able to question them. We were able to learn that the Syndicate was testing an updated version of their alchemical super soldier serum that had been administered at a Rae Lake village lab.</p>
