# Alcohol Brewing

## Special Brews

If a player has Proficiency in Brewing Supplies they can craft special special brews.

All special brews have the following properties:
- **Threshold**: The cumulative total you need to reach to complete the brew (one roll per time unit)
- **Cost**: The cost of ingredients paid upon starting the brewing process.
- **Servings**: How many servings are created. Once the cask is opened, it must be used immediately. No servings can be saved.
- **DC**: Overindulging in alcoholic beverages can have consequences. After gaining the benefits of the drink, make a con save. If one drink was consumed, the DC is the base number. For each serving beyond the first a character consumes, the DC increases by the increment given in parentheses. On a failure, the character is poisoned for the entirety of the short rest period but recovers prior to the Monday missions.
- **Benefit**: What the drink does for you.

## Basic Recipes

All people with Brewing Supplies proficiency can make basic special brews

### Restorative Riesling

- **Threshold**: 50 - Brewer's Supplies
- **Cost**: 50gp
- **Servings**: 5
- **DC**: 5 (+3 per drink)

If you spend a hit die to regain HP on a short rest, you may regain one additional d10 of HP. You may only benefit from additional servings of the Restorative Riesling if you spent additional hit dice.


### Studious Sangria

- **Threshold**: 50 - Brewer's Supplies
- **Cost**: 50gp
- **Servings**: 5
- **DC**: 5 (+3 per drink)

If your next time unit spent is to perform research or learn a new skill, the roll is made at advantage. Additional servings apply to subsequent time unit rolls but must be within the same rest period.
