# Attacks of Opportunity

Creatures with melee weapons threaten all squares within 5ft. Whenever any enemy uses their own movement to leave a threatened square (even if they are still within the creature's threat range) the enemy has provoked an attack of opportunity.
As usual, creatures can spend their reaction to make one melee weapon attack against the moving creature, they have one reaction per round, and their reaction is regained after they take their turn.
