<p>A Wood elf stands before you, his coffee eyes showing disinterest in all around him even though his face is smiling serenely. Oddly, he does not have any weapons or armor within sight, instead he is wearing brown and dark green vestments, which has a golden Oak tree embroidered on the chest. The green of the vestments compliments his hair and goatee, being a 2 shades lighter in color. His copper skin has no blemishes except for an intricate tattoo on his right hand, which glows when he introduces himself.</p>

<p>Theren is the first born of his family, being born from loving parents. His love for learning had him originally pursuing a career in research before his Life Cleric powers were revealed at the age of 35. It was a blessing in disguise, since it allowed him to roam the world on different pilgrimages, seeing quite a bit the world has to offer.</p>
<p>He was ecstatic to welcome his baby sister, and devastated with her death a few years later when the village was attacked by raiders. This lead to him meeting his adopted little sister, Reysatra.</p>

<p>Theren went on a mission with several veteran guild members to clear out a kruthik hive. Several kruthiks realized he was a threat and proceeded to slash him along the belly in the final moments of the battle. Guildmembers saw him go down but was breathing at the time the portal pulled the team back. However, they found he died inbetween the moments the portal took him back and it brought him back to the guildhall.</p>

<p><em>Chuck silently glides into the memorial room, dressed in her nun’s habit. She also takes a seat. She didn’t know Theren well, only attending one clean up mission where he drove the cart that she was guarding. Oh, and there was that Snorkles Mission, too. But she saw him in the infirmary. A lot. He was attentive to his patients. Researching many hours into tomes way above her comprehension. Chuck may not have made a deep connection with Theren but she does know Ni Ama. And her heart breaks because she knows that the loss of Theren is almost killing her friend.</em></p>
<p><em>Sister Charles (now in the dress befitting of her formal name)slowly arises from her seat in the back. She comes forward in a stately manner befitting the solemnity of the occasion to the podium</em></p>
<p>“Dear faithful hearted Theren. Healer. Protector. Lover of trees. Child of the wood and wind. Guardian of the weak, the vulnerable, the downtrodden. Faithful in performing your duties with excellence and diligence. You risked your life so many times to save others, including mine. Your clear thinking, fierce love of sister and friend, made you respected by all in this guild. You will be fondly remembered as the face of the infirmary as you cared for your patients as thoroughly there as upon the battle field. Know that you will be missed. Know that what you loved and guarded…”</p>
<p><em>here she looks at Rey and Ni Ama</em></p>
<p>“…will be cherished, loved and guarded in your stead by those who remain. Sleep long and rest, our model and inspiration of what it means to be a guild member.”</p>
<p>Sister Charles now steps from the podium to offer her sincerest condolences to Rey and Ni Ama in the form of a long and tearful hug.</p>

<p>“We are all so saddened and shocked by the loss of Theren. Like Reysatra said, it was maybe hard for some of us to know him well, so protective that he was of himself. But you could not help but admire how he enveloped those he loved in that same level of protection. He would do anything to keep Rey and Ni Ama safe, and there was no doubting his strength to keep his word there. He kept so many of the rest of us in the Guild safe and healthy, even as just part of his very distant extended family. This world is a worse place without him.”</p>
<p>“Ni Ama, Rey, I’m so sorry. Where Theren was, we will be there for you, but I know it’s a sorry replacement.”</p>

<p>Illantriss approaches the front next, guilt evident on her face as she addresses the attendants.</p>
<p>“Theren…was a contentious person. I cannot say I liked him all that much when we met. I thought him too strict, too masked, too tightly tied to duty. I failed to see the intention and reason behind many of his actions and personality. So, I missed his unending care for others, his curiosity and ingenuity, and how deeply he treasured and cared for those important to him.</p>
<p><em>voice breaking for a second.</em>
I…am so sorry I failed him when he needed help. Help he gave to everyone, and in his moment of needing it, my best…wasn’t enough. Which. He would find completely unacceptable to remain as such. I can only promise his spirit that I will grow, improve, and protect those he loved as if they were my own.</p>
<p>….and…I’m so…sorry. So sorry loves.”</p>
<p><em>tears brimming in her eyes, Illantriss leans down to kiss Reysatra on the head, and hugging Ni Ama quickly before moving to the back.</em></p>

<p><em>Bavazi steps up to the podium.</em></p>
<p>&quot;While I didn&#x27;t know Theren too well I do know he was plenty things I am not.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He was so smart. You can tell that by all the papers on his desk in the infirmary. And he used those brains to help others. I respect him so much for that.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I too am responsible for his loss. I add that to my growing list of failures. It makes me question what it is I&#x27;m doing here.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But I took a quick trip across Lemuria. I saw so many people and creatures that can&#x27;t protect themselves. And now Theren is not around to help them. So I dedicate myself once more in Theren&#x27;s name to continue fighting evil. &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;To anyone out there looking to hurt the weak: I am coming for you. The Lemurian Guild is coming for you. And you are not S.A.F.E!&quot;</p>
<p><em>Bavazi takes out a little S.A.F.E. poster, folds it up, and slips it into Theren&#x27;s pocket.</em></p>
<p><em>Bavazi turns his head to hide the fact that he is wiping a tear then steps down and walks to the back of the room.</em></p>
<p><em>Bavazi finds Ozryn in the room and goes over to him and gives him a big hug.</em></p>

<p>“Farewell, Theren. I shall remember you for your graciousness. For your wisdom and unfailing dedication. For your readiness to help anyone you could. And,” Eligos looks sheepish, “for your interesting sense of humor. I learned a lesson about flowers from you, and hopefully the florist did not lead me astray. I imagine you would give us a period of mourning, then reprimand us for moping and wasting time on something that we have no control over. Perhaps all that will matter to you is this: Reysatra and Ni Ama will not be without support in your absence. Their wings are tired but not crippled; they can ride the slipstream until they’ve recovered. Until then I – we, their friends – will take point. I have faith they will soar again... ... ᵀʰᵉ ᶦⁿᶠᶦʳᵐᵃʳʸ ʷᶦˡˡ ᶠᵉᵉˡ ᵛᵃᶜᵃⁿᵗ ʷᶦᵗʰᵒᵘᵗ ʸᵒᵘʳ ᵖʳᵉˢᵉⁿᶜᵉ ᵗʰᵉʳᵉ”</p>

<p><em>slowly stands, oblivious to the presence and warmth of the hugs from the people around her. Cold as ice to the touch, she stares unseeing ahead, before making her way to Theren&#x27;s body.</em></p>
<p>&quot;Time. There should have been more time. You were so strong. So proud. So infinitely precious...to me. Your mask was your armor, your shield, which protected a soul so kind, that you hid it. continuing on brokenly. I loved seeing you in the rare moments where you were simply yourself. I was honored and blessed in that. But.... fresh tears spill from pale blue eyes, now I know the pain of what it is to no longer have you. And it is almost more than I can bear. I pray...the stars guide your soul to its place...and that one day...I may find it.&quot;</p>
<p><em>like in so many other funerals, Ni Ama reaches her hand down into the coffin to entice flowers to grow. However, this time....none do. Her eyes widen slightly in horror, and looks at her frosted hands, as if only now realizing...she isn&#x27;t Spring anymore.</em></p>

<p>&quot;I have never met you but I wish I did. You smelled like the wyrwood forests where I was born. You clearly were an exceptional man so let me try to give you a send-off worthy of an elvish hero.&quot;</p>
<p><em>Balsa paces about Theren’s casket and Balsa places a spirit totem at his feat. Starts chanting in spells and speaking to the animals in what fellow druids realize is Druidic. Torches and flames surrounding the Theren&#x27;s casket begin to flicker one by one. Their flames slowly grow dimmer until they suddenly all flash into a bright flame. Each flame forms a unique image of Theren. One is of him studying. Another is of him sitting beside a tree and talking to his sister. Another sees him holding the hand of an Eladrin.</em> (cast <strong>control flames</strong>)</p>
<p>&quot;Life of the guild, bear witness to this paragon of faith. A brother of the forest was lost to us and let us mourn. There will never be another like him. LIFE OF LUMERIA I CALL YOU&quot; (Uses Druid of the Shepard Circle ability: **Speech of the Woods **that allows all beasts to understand him and for him to understand them)</p>
<p><em>The totem begins to shine and a majestic, translucent blue unicorn emerges. A large fey Raven swoops down from the sky and caws into greating to everyone. Suddenly flocks of ducks, murders of crows, parliments of owls, rats, mice, ants, beetles, and all of the creatures that live in the garden come out.</em> (Uses Druid of the Shepard Circle abilities: **Spirit Totem **&amp; <strong>Wild Companion</strong></p>
<p>&quot;Friends of the forest, let us show respect to our forest brother.&quot;</p>
<p><em>The unicorn walks up to Theren&#x27;s casket and bows. The unicorn touches Theren&#x27;s Sapling and it begins to glow emerald green. The garden tree surrounding Theren&#x27;s casket suddenly glow alight into a 1000 different shades of green. Each leaf glows a unique shade of green just like the thousand colors behind that singular, always smiling elf. The unicorn, Balsa, and forest creatures bow to Theren&#x27;s casket.</em> (Cast <strong>Fairie Fire</strong>)</p>
<p>&quot;Theren leaves behind a sister and a lover. This death was too soon. It is right to feel sorrow but hope for he goes back to nature&#x27;s embrace. And it is also right to feel RAGE. THEREN DID NOT NEED TO DIE YET. HIS FRIENDS DID NOT NEED HIM TO DIE&quot;</p>
<p><em>Balsabarkno&#x27;s healthy brown wood turns to a sickly greys. His head grows sinister antlers. His eyes turn crimson red. The funeral&#x27;s green flames turn red hot with fury.</em> (cast <strong>Primal Savagery</strong>)</p>
