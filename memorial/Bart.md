## Background

Bart, short for Bartholemew, is a half-orc fighter who's convinced he's a wizard.
He has studied long and hard in the ancient art of "Stick Magic".
Stick Magic is a highly complex and difficult school of magic that uses sticks, sticks with points, and sticks with rocks as foci to apply blunt force trauma to a spell's victims.
In other words, he hits or throws things very hard and fast.
Bart is not the brightest, is a bit too excited by shipping other guild members, and possibly poisoned people with his bad cooking but he is unwaveringly loyal.

Bart is known for using a sickly looking quarterstaff he carved out of Plague Tree wood he obtained from his first guild mission.
He was an expert at use throwing weapons that he would call "spells".

While at the guild Bart became best friends with Leal'tad. Bart took them in as a pupil and taught them stick magic. They became so close they developed a combo attack called the "Fastball Special" where they'd fling the other into the enemy.

Bart is the owner of Venomlisous Bites, a kabob shop that sells possibly poisonous kabobs.

## Death

Bart died following a Snorkles Response mission. Leal'tad and Gen, their goblin-fiend child companion, seemingly died due too an unfortunate accident. Distraught, Bart made a pact with the fiendish side of Gen. He offered his soul and mind in exchange for the life of his pupil and the child. The pact was sealed and the contract signed. Bart fell to the ground dead in the middle of the guildhall.

It was later realized that Leal'tad and Gen were not dead and that Bart's death was in vain. Despite the pointlessness, Bart looked determined and happy in his final moments. He kept his promise and kept others alive until his last breath.

### Memorial - Last Words

#### Openning Words - Commander Cecilla

> The open space at the center of the hall is prepared with chairs and a small stage. Bart is carried into the room by some of those closest to him, his body perfectly preserved such that he looks like he's only sleeping. Penelope places a painting up on the stage. It's impeccable, capturing Bart in a bright smile in the gardens with perfect precision.
>
> Cecilia steps up to the podium first. "Today we gather to mourn and honor the life of Bartholomew, or Bart as we all knew him. He embodied the courage that this Guild stands for. He would throw himself into the fray with hardly a thought to his own safety if it meant protecting others. He strove to improve himself and his combat abilities so that he could extend that protection further and further. In the end, he chose to sacrifice himself to save those he loved. We honor him, and all that he gave for us."
>
> She steps aside for others to speak if they wish.

#### Red Paw

> Red Paw sneaks into the memorial before the service starts. He pulls a stick out of his pocket and places it on the display for Bart. The sound echoes out as if a stone was placed instead. He takes a step back and looks at the image chosen. "Bart, you were fun. I guess I'll never be able to take you up on those stick magic lessons now."
> The kobold takes a deep breath, closing his eyes briefly, before sneaking back out while there is still no other guild members.

#### Leono

> Leono looks around and steps up nervously, hoping to break the seal for others. “I didn’t know Bart well, but everyone in the Guild couldn’t help but know of him: boisterous, brave, joyful, kind. I don’t know if I’ve ever laughed as hard as seeing him and Lea practicing their special move in the tavern, and I definitely tried and regretted my share of his kebabs. He was a bright light among us all. He’ll really be missed.”

#### Theren

> Theren approaches Bart's body, he gently places a glowing seed upon his chest.
>
> "This is not the end of your journey Bart, tis only the beginning of a different chapter. With this seed, a tree as mighty and humble as you shall grow."
>
> "What you have done for this Guild will not be forgotten, and will live on with the new form you shall take."
>
> As he begins to leave, he stops for a moment.
>
> "Thank you, for keeping your promise."
>
> With that Theren steps back into the crowd.

#### Ni Ama

> Ni Ama enters the room, her hair unbound and absent of flowers, in a long black dress, reminiscent of fallen leaves. She somberly approaches the coffin, hands cupped in front of her.
>
> “\<\< I am sorry I could not save you, as you tried to do for so many of us. I do not know if your soul is at peace, but I hope you know you will not be forgotten here. Thus your legacy lives on.”\>\> (Sylvan speakers)
> “May your journeys be easy Bart. I….shall miss you greatly.”
> placing what was in her hands around Bart’s body, the air hums around Ni Ama as lily of the valley blooms around him.
> “I hope….perhaps…I will meet your soul in another form one day.”
> the last seedling in her hand blooms. A fairy lily. Symbolizing rebirth and hope. She places it on his chest, then steps back to join the group.

#### Reysatra

> Reysatra approaches after, she kneels down with both knees touching the ground, before Bart's body.
>
> "You- always- keep- every--one safe-- always- make - sure we- bring- come?- back. I ad-mire you" A hitch in her voice causes her to clear her throat "Garden- will- be- quiet- now" She speaks slowly before bowing her head
>
> "I- I- I - am - sorry" a sob escapes, she covers her face with her hands and begins to speak in Elvish
> \<\<My last words to you were harsh, I didn't want those to be the last ones. I just wanted to make sure there were no regrets. I should have been more understanding. I am so sorry.\>\>

#### Chuck

> Chuck stiffly walks forward as the solemn occasion demands formality but she is uncomfortable with it.
> “Bart- I only had one chance to adventure with you, but it was a defining moment. The moment when you brilliantly discovered marshmallows could potentially be used as a weapon. This is how I choose to remember you, excited, gleeful, inventive and just, plain fun. What I didn’t know was the dedication, the hard work, the self sacrifice and the protect at all costs you offered to this place and to these people. Thank you for the positive impact your life has made in all those around you, including me.”
> At this point, Chuck uses shape water to make a cat. The cat leaps delicately onto the body and nuzzles Bart’s face before disappearing.

#### Eligos

> Eligos walks up to set a feather at top of the pillow in which Bart's head rests. He opens and closes his beak, at as loss for words.
>
> After a long silence, he sighs before saying, "You died as you had lived: devoting yourself to your friends with reckless abandon. Many of us would not be here if not for your bravery, and every battle seemed less impossible with your presence. Thank you for buoying our spirits and bringing joy in the rest between missions."
>
> Eligos' bows deeply. "It is my only solace to know that you would not have regretted your actions. Choosing how you die is a gift many in our line of work don't get. I hope your choice brought you peace."
>
> Eligos leaves the memorial hall.

#### Star

> Star tearfully brings flowers to the memorial and places them before Bart's body.
>
> Bart, I'm sorry I never got to meet you. It's clear you've been deeply loved by many.
>
> May you rest in peace, may your soul live on in a new form. Will wait for that day.
>
> Star leaves quietly among the mourners.

#### Draven

> Draven brings a bucket of sticks.
> "This is for you dude."
> He spreads the sticks around the bed.

#### Illantris

> From the back of the room, Illantriss starts [a traditional sending away song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8ir8rVl2Z4&ab_channel=WaterTowerMusic), her lute accompanying her voice.

#### Cheya and Leal'tad

> Lea and Cheya walk in, their normal clothing Prestidigitated to black. Cheya has Gen propped on her hip, and there's the hazy outline of an Unseen Servant supporting Lea as they seem not entirely able to stay on their feet.
> Cheya approaches the funeral altar, head bowed as snowflakes start to coalesce from the air and cling to her hair and skin. "Bartholomew. My fellow wizard."
> "When I joined this guild, I only thought to find better avenues to pursue arcane knowledge. I did not expect to find anyone so noble as you - I entrusted you with the well-being of my friend, and you proved yourself entirely worthy of that trust. Thank you for bringing them back safely to me, even at such a high cost."
> "Wherever you are, I hope... I hope that you are not alone."
>
> When Lea doesn't move forward on their own, Cheya puts Gen down and takes their arm to lead them carefully towards Bart's body. They stand there for a few minutes, mouthing words in a low mournful hum of whispered Celestial, before turning their head and refusing to look any longer.

#### Bard

> Bard walks up and places a knotted rope atop Barts Chest “I will always cherish the memory of you dangling Fitz on a stick with this rope. May it also symbolize the bond we share as you saved my life that same day, I’m sorry I was not there for you my friend”
>
> Bard salutes as tears stream down his face
