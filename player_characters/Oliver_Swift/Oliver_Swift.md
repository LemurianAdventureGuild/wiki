## Backstory

Oliver Swift spent most of his meager 15 years in Stone Cold Home.  It was a frigid orphanage that was secretly a front for organized youth crime led by Matron Malice and Warden Wretched.  The adult pair trained impressionable youths to theft, breakins, and racketeering.  In the early mornings, like other boys, Oliver would be outsourced for grim jobs like chimney cleaning or collecting bat guano. In evenings, he would lift purses/jewelries or commit smash and grabs.  The days typically end back at orphanage, being malnourished from thin gruel and cherry water.

Oliver's crime career abruptly changed during an attempted housebreaking on a merchant's manor.  Oliver tripped a poison trap, leaving him injured and unconscious while his fellow orphans fled.  The owner, retired illusionist Fafhardy, took pity on the boy.  Fafhardy bandaged his wounds and taught him magic tricks to enhance his thieving skills.  Oliver enjoyed 7 comfortable months under the illusionist's protection until  Fafhardy abruptly vanished on a trip.  Without his patron, the bank quickly seized the home for unpaid taxes. Possessing only a fragile knowledge of the arcane, Oliver was left back on the streets.
