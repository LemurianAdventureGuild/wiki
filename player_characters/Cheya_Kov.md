### Leaving the Guild

Following Bart's passing and Leal'tad becoming a fallen aasimar, Cheya took them and Gen from the guild . They left the night of Bart's viking funeral without a word goodbye but they left behind several letters to their close friends. 

There are rumors that a wandering Eldarin carrying a goblin child is looking for way to help repair a fallen aasimar's halo. 

#### Theren's Letter
> Theren,
> 
> I am leaving this letter where I hope that you will find it first, as I think you are the most likely to understand why I am writing it.
> 
> The first time I met Leal'tad, they were escorting a local noble's daughter to commission some work from me, and they were radiant - winged, haloed in unbroken bronze, completely self-assured. The second time I met them, shortly after their charge was ambushed and murdered despite their best attempts to protect her, they looked quite different. They told me later than an aasimar's appearance and the integrity of their halo are largely contingent on their ability to hold faith, both in the world at large and in themselves.
> 
> I have never seen them look as broken as they do now. 
> 
> For this reason, among others - a primary one being that I have recently discovered that Leal'tad is dealt physical damage every time Genevieve is more than a few feet away from them, which renders it nearly impossible for them to fight safely with or without Genevieve nearby - we have decided that it is necessary for us to withdraw from the Guild. You also have a duty of care towards someone who seems intent on throwing herself into danger on behalf of others, so I hope that you will appreciate that this action is not taken lightly while not feeling the need to interfere.
> 
> We have paid all the requisite fines and acquired permission to take Genevieve with us, do not worry. I only ask that you would wait a few days before passing on the attached notes so that the others, well meaning though they may be, will not interfere either.
> 
> Thank you. I wish you peace and whatever grace fate is willing to offer in your own dealings.
> 
> -*Cheya Kov*

#### Eligos' Letter
> Eligos,
> 
> Your dedication to gaining knowledge and protecting the Guild is admirable, and I have enjoyed working with you. Please accept Bartholemew's staff as bequeathed by Leal'tad and myself - I trust that you would know best what to do with it, whether that is preserving it for his memory, placing it in shared Guild usage, or asking Khajit to tailor it more to your own tastes. 
> 
> (Please note that Bartholemew gave me arrows made from similar material, and I have noticed that they do extra damage to their wielder as well as their target. Perhaps you can gift it to Ashe if he continues to be under suspicion.)
> 
> -*Cheya Kov*. 

#### Chuck's Letter
> Chuck,
> 
> Thank you for the care you have extended to myself and Leal'tad over these past few weeks. I am sorry to leave you in the middle of your project, but I wish you the best of luck in completing it and in continuing to practice your trademark grace and kindness within the guild. I hope that these offerings will be helpful - I have been telling Leal'tad about your exploits and your goals in the past few days when they have had trouble sleeping, and they offered their assistance as well, saying that Bart would have loved to see such a project completed. 
> 
> [In Lea's room, you'll find a copy of Chuck's fountain blueprints that Cheya has been carrying around with her, including annotations and the beginnings of prototypes for the pumps.]

#### Ni Ama's Letter
> Ni Ama,
> 
> I am sorry to rob you of even a poor reminder of your home, but I have other responsibilities to attend to outside the guild. Please take [these 7 plague tree arrows] as a token of my respect for you and a reminder that you do not always have to be happy and kind, if you are not inclined to do so.
> 
> With Leal'tad's help, I have also attempted to compile their and Bart's more... sensational... joint pursuit. Personally I do not see the appeal, but I hope that you will enjoy them and wish you the best of luck in making them reality.
> 
> [You'll also find a neatly bound compilation of all the Theren/Ni Ama fanart and fic that Lea and Bart were working on. The drawings and some notes are all done by those two, but there's some much neater summaries and prose sections that look like Cheya put some work into turning this into a coherent narrative. It ends with an illustration of Ni Ama carrying an unconscious Theren bridal style towards the guild dormitories.]
