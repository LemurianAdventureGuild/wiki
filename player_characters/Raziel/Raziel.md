## Background

Born into an ordinary family with uncommon gifts, everyone has always expected great things of Raziel. Under the weight of heavy expectations, Raziel sought out the Guild in Capital City for a fresh start. He did not cause world-altering consequences on his fourth mission like Fenris, which he's slightly disappointed about.
