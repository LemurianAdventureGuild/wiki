## Background

Full Name: Theodore Bear

### Leaving the Guild

> Teddy appears to be missing for several days before his empty room is noticed and a note is found. In it, the letter mentions the last battle with the overpowering Sea Hags where all of his companions were down and he had to retreat to save them.  It lead him to an existential crisis and he had to leave. He doesn't say where he went, just that he had to walk these Bad Lands alone. Teddy is gone.
