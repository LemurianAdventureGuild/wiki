## Background

Lomiomyldor rarely opens up about his past, but he lived through terrible things in the desolate Shadowfell and longed for release. One day, he followed a pathway of moonlight and crossed over to the Material Plane, crediting Selune and worshipping her ever since. He takes joy in vibrant colors and light.
